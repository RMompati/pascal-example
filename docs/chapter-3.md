# Chapter 3: Scanning

> The scanner is the component in the frontend of the compiler or interpreter
> tha performs the syntactic actions of reading the source program and
> breaking it into tokens.

### Goals and Approach
> #### The scanner should be able to:
> - Extract Pascal word, number, string, and special symbol tokens from the source program.
> - Determine whether a word token is an identifier or a Pascal reserved word.
> - Calculate the value of a number token and determine whether its type is integer or real.
> - Perform syntax error handling.
