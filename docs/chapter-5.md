# Parsing Expressions
> ### And Assignment Statements
<hr>

### Goals and approach
> - Parsers in the front end for certain Pascal constructs: compound statements, assignment statements, and expressions.
> - Flexible, language-independent intermediate code generated by the parsers to represent these constructs.

### Syntax Diagrams | Rules

> ### Statement
> ```
> statement = compoundStatement | assignmentStatement
>```
> ### Statement List
> ```
> statmentList = statment ";" | statment ";" statementList
>```
> ### Compound Statement
> ```
> compoundStatement = "BEGIN" statmentList "END"
>```
> ### Assignment Statement
> ```
> assignmentStatement = variable ":=" expression
>```
> ### An Expression
> ```
> expression =  simpleExpression rel_op simpleExpression
> ```
> ### Relational Operators
>```
> rel_op = "=" | "<>" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">="
> ```
> ### Simple Expression
> ```
> simpleExpression = neg_op term | simpleExpression add_op term
> ```
> ### Negation Operators
> ```
> neg_op = "-" | "+" | Îµ
> ```
> ### Additive Operators
> ```
> add_op = "+" | "-" | "OR"
> ```
> ### Term
> ```
> term = factor | term mul_op factor
> ```
> ### Multiplicative Operators
>```
> mul_op = "*" | "/" | "AND" | "DIV" | "MOD"
>```
> ### Factor
> ```
> factor = variable | number | string | "NOT" factor | "(" expression ")"
> ```
> ### Variable
> ```
> variable = identifier
>```
> ### String
> ```
> string = "'" (char | whitespace)* "'"
>```
> ### Number
> ```
> number = digit+
>```
> ### Identifier
> ```
> identifier = char[char _]*
>```
> ### Digit
> ```
> digit = [0-9]
>```
> ### Char
> ```
> char = [a-zA-Z]
>```
> ### Whitespaces
> ```
> whitespace = [\t\r\n ]
>```
